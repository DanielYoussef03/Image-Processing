# Geometric Transformation in Image Processing
Overview: 

This project implements various geometric transformations in image processing to modify the spatial characteristics of digital images. Geometric transformations play a crucial role in tasks such as image registration, resizing, rotation, and distortion correction. This repository provides a set of functions and examples for performing common geometric transformations on images.

# Features
Translation: Shift the entire image by a specified distance along the x and/or y axes.
Rotation: Rotate the image by a chosen angle around a pivot point.
Scaling: Enlarge or reduce the size of an image.
